## Overview
This project involves the design, simulation, and verification of a **CMOS inverter** using **Cadence Virtuoso** with the **GPdk090 technology library**. The key steps include:

- **Schematic Design**: Using PMOS and NMOS transistors.
- **Gate Level Design**: Logical representation of the inverter.
- **Simulation**: Transient and DC analysis for performance evaluation.
- **Layout Design**: Optimized physical layout with metal, polysilicon, and vias.
- **Verification**: DRC, LVS checks to ensure design integrity.
- **RCX Extraction**: Extracting parasitic resistances/capacitances for accuracy.
- **Final Simulation**: Comparison of schematic and layout outputs.

## Technology Used
- **Cadence Virtuoso** with **GPdk090** library
- **Assura** for DRC, LVS, and RCX extraction

## Key Results
Validated CMOS inverter design with minimal delay and consistent output across schematic and layout.
